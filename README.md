# Vault of Bonk Games

## The basics


This was an old repository that I filled up with games a long time ago.
Most of them don't work well especially with the new versions of python that
have come and gone. Feel free to submit new pull requests with other games.


## The history


This was as I said, an old repository with old games, on an old account. Which is why I am using this account to be reviving it! I can't wait to see the new games and start using it.
They should work on any system the has python 3.x on it. It may require some modules but I will add a requirements.txt.


## The future


I want this to be a full on vault with a community where other people can submit there own games.
Feel free to look at the old repo and see how bad my coding was XD. Also most of the old scripts were not mine.
Since it's been so long, I unfortunately don't have the links to where I got them but there may be some clues in the code.
